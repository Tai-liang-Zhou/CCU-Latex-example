In the recent years, the related research and development of service robots have become more and more popular. The key to service robots is the ability of natural language. In this paper, we use the reinforcement learning language model to build a conversation service chatbot. Moreover, we train a sequence to sequence model with an adversarial network. We calculate three types of rewards to assign low rewards for repeated sentences and high rewards for diverse sentences. Therefore, the generated sentences are diverse and grammatically correct. To evaluate our chatbot, we compare with a rule-based chatbot, a retrieval-based chatbot, and a traditional generative-based chatbot. There are two findings as follows. First, unlike a rule-based chatbot, adding responses for each asks is not needed. Second, our model outperforms in generating more diverse responses than those of a retrieval-based chatbot. Third, compared with the traditional generation model, our model has more diverse and richer information. In addition, our model generates the corresponding action codes for the chatbot to service people.
